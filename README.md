# ConvertPrototypicalGLD
## Purpose
This converts the .glm code for the GridLAB-D Prototypical Feeders to a simplified representation as a MATLAB graph. 

## Source
Source .glm files were downloaded from  https://sourceforge.net/p/gridlab-d/code/HEAD/tree/Taxonomy_Feeders/ on 19 Sep 19. These files are stored in the folder "\glm".

## Process
To repeat this analysis:
1. Clear the folder "\results"
2. Run parseGLM to convert each .glm into a string array
3. Run convertGLM to convert string array into graph() objects
...more to come...


## Results
